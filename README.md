# AirlinesDelay_AIModel
This project predicts flight delays by integrating cleaned flight data (date, time, distance, performance) with weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation) from the Open-Meteo API, matched by city. The dataset is used to train ML models on Amazon SageMaker.
